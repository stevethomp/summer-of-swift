# StarBridge

## Description

Inspired by games like FTL and Spacrteam, and board games like Space Cadets and Galaxy Trucker, I want to make a fun and fast starship simulator for multiple players. It will use AirPlay to turn an Apple TV into the viewport, and every device will be a a different console on the bridge.

I’ll be writing the project in Swift, and taking advantage of many of the new SpriteKit features in iOS 8. Also multipeer connectivity and possibly diving into some SceneKit to make it fancier.

Name is currently under construction.

## Updates


### July 15
I added basic Multipeer (Thanks JP and MPCMultipeerClient) and am working on getting basic notifications and communication between the different devices working. I'm also trying to decide on final game design, with a focus on how a game will work and what each station will be doing.

The name is still terrible and in progress.

### July 29
I have basic airplay working, and a rough idea of what each station will do. I wasn't able to make much progress but have some simple frameworks and foundations laid out.

Next steps:
- Get multipeer running and passing events
- Get logic working in GameManager to deal with events, and pass them to appropriate devices
- Implement four stations with simple gameplay
- Add enemy ships and 'adventure' mode
